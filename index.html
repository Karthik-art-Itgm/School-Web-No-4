        <p>School canteens may operate under a variety of management structures, depending on the individual characteristics and needs of the school. Most canteens in schools are run under the direction of, and are accountable to, the school council. Schools may decide to provide a food service to students in several ways.</p>

        <p>The ideal time attendance solution is one that neither a manager nor an employee needs to engage—it should be autonomous, requiring input only when absolutely necessary. Unlike keycard-based clock-in systems or other manual solutions, time and attendance software requires no interaction. Enter DeskTime: the time attendance solution that tracks an employee from the moment they turn on the computer. Regardless of whether they walk away for a break, go to a meeting, or are absent altogether, you will always know their attendance status.</p>
